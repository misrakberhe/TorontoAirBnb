One reason might be that since this data is a snapshot from early December, there aren't many events that would bring tourists to Toronto. Summer is the best time to come to the city and it might be better to look at the data coming from closer to the summer season, when people maybe booking more in preparation.\n",

The issue with making the dates more granular is that there will be ranges or times of the year that will be difficult to represent in a column unless I'm willing to balloon the size of the dateframe by an additional 365 columns. \n",

There is a large chance (and I believe there is) that between the times when data is pulled, we are missing a large amount of booking information. Which would make the data related to bookings less reliable and harder to tie to the amenities.\n"
